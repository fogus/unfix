Are you completely tired of parentheses? [unfix][u]&copy; can help!

Observe the following Clojure code:

    (- (+ 5 (* 4 (+ 1 2))) 3)
    ;=> 14

That sure is a lot of parentheses for such a simple formula.  Thankfully, using unfix&copy;'s patented infix&reg; technology, we can clean it up a bit:

    (infix 
      5 + [[1 + 2] * 4] - 3)
    ;=> 14

However, there are still parenthesis-like things used that are quite disorienting.  [unfix][u]&copy; to the rescue again:

    (postfix
      5 1 2 + 4 * + 3 -)
    ;=> [14]

Amazingly, every single parentheses and parenthesis-like things have disappeared in a puff of Charles Leonard Hamblin's pipe smoke!  Using [unfix][u]&copy;'s patented[^pat] postfix&reg;, technology you can drastically reduce your reliance on parentheses and parenthesis-like things:

    (postfix "There" ", " "all " "unbetter" str str str)
    ;=> ["There, all unbetter"]
